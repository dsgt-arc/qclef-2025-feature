# Repo structure

* doc/ stores relevant diagrams, documents (not papers) which may be relevant
* data/ in case we need to store (small pieces of) data. Bigger data should be e.g. on google drive.
* organizers-code/ in case there is starter code from the organizers 
* .gitignore make sure we keep the repo clean
